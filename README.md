# AI RESUME BUILDERS

A complete, production-ready AI-powered resume builder — built with **React 18**, **React Router**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Create, customize, preview and export ATS-friendly resumes using 10 professional templates, an in-browser AI writing assistant, and a real-time ATS scoring engine.

> All data is stored locally in the browser (`localStorage`) — there is no backend. The "AI" features run entirely client-side using curated content engines (see [`How the AI features work`](#how-the-ai-features-work) below), so the whole app works offline and requires no API keys.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was built and validated in a sandboxed environment without npm registry access, so dependencies could not be pre-installed here — **you'll install them the first time you run it locally**, same as any fresh clone.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Open the printed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build      # outputs to /dist
npm run preview    # preview the production build locally
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (Node 20+ recommended)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)

## 🧠 How the AI features work

There's no external API call (and so, no API key to configure). `src/utils/aiGenerator.js` and `src/utils/atsScorer.js` implement deterministic, content-aware generation and scoring using the resume's own data — phrase banks for summaries/objectives/project descriptions, a role-keyed skill bank (`src/data/skillSuggestions.js`), and a rules engine for improvement suggestions and the ATS score breakdown.

**To swap in a real LLM later:** every generator function (`generateSummary`, `generateObjective`, `generateProjectDescription`, `suggestSkills`, `generateImprovementSuggestions`) already returns a `Promise` and has a stable signature — replace the function body with a `fetch()` call to your model provider of choice and nothing else in the app needs to change.

## 📄 PDF Export

`ResumePreview` renders the active template **twice**: a scaled, visible copy for on-screen editing, and an off-screen, full-resolution copy (`#resume-print-area`) at true A4 width. `BuilderToolbar`'s **Download PDF** button captures that hidden node with `html2canvas` at 2.5× scale and tiles it across as many A4 pages as needed with `jsPDF`, so the exported file always matches the live preview exactly. **Print** uses the browser's native print dialog against the same node via the print styles in `index.css`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI library | React 18 |
| Routing | React Router 6 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 (custom design tokens: `ink`, `paper`, `brand`) |
| Icons | react-icons (Heroicons set) |
| PDF export | jsPDF + html2canvas |
| Build tool | Vite |
| Persistence | Browser `localStorage` (no backend) |

## 📦 Notes for production deployment

- Run `npm run build` and deploy the `/dist` folder to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, S3, etc.) — no server runtime is required.
- Because resumes are stored in `localStorage`, each browser/device has its own resume library. Wire `ResumeContext.jsx` up to a real API if you need cross-device sync.
- The favicon and meta tags in `index.html` are already set up for basic SEO/social sharing — update the URLs once you have a real domain.
